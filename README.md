# Building a Watch Face Service

Android Wear watch faces are services that are packaged inside a wearable app.

When users select one of the available watch faces, the wearable device shows the watch face
and invokes its service callback methods.

## Requirements:
Target device: Smart Watches with Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)

## Getting started:
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/technoboom/android-active-watch-face`

Build and run the project.
